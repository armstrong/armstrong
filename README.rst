Armstrong
=========
Armstrong is an open-source publishing system designed for news organizations
that gives your team the technology edge it needs to report in a media-rich
environment.

State of Project
----------------
Armstrong is an open-source news platform that is freely available to any
organization.  It is the result of a collaboration between the `Texas Tribune`_
and `Bay Citizen`_, and a grant from the `John S. and James L. Knight
Foundation`_.  The first release is scheduled for June, 2011.

To follow development, be sure to join the `Google Group`_.
